					<h2>We are Social by Design</h2>

					<p>The xDesign conference is Harvard University's annual exploration of all things design. In a world at once together and apart, this year's conference explores the theme SocialxDesign. We'll engage with thinkers, doers, and leaders from across disciplines and sectors. Along the way, we'll discover what it takes to design for social assembly, connection, and trust. Let's get social, by design.</p>
