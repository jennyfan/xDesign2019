					<h2>We are Social by Design</h2>

					<p>The xDesign conference is Harvard University's annual exploration of all things design. In a world at once together and apart, this year's conference explores the theme SocialxDesign. We'll engage with thinkers, doers, and leaders from across disciplines and sectors. Along the way, we'll discover what it takes to design for social assembly, connection, and trust. Let's get social, by design.</p>

His work with large brands, design, media and technology companies is extending narrative thinking and storytelling to products and disciplines far outside traditional application. A native Swede, Mr. Liedgren started his career as a management consultant in Stockholm, worked for Microsoft in Scandinavia, Paris and Seattle, and has since supported entrepreneurial ventures as board member of both private and publicly traded companies. Mr. Liedgren lives in Seattle with his family where he works, writes and speaks about narrative structure and story, and continues to make very independent feature films.</p>
